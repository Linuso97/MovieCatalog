This project is designed to allow users to save movies they wish to watch in a database using SQL Server,
while leveraging an external API (OMDB) for additional movie data. It implements CRUD operations
to manage both the local database and interactions with the external API.

To enhance understanding of the project's structure and functionality, I have included a summary for each file,
detailing the purpose and reasoning behind the choices made throughout the development process.
